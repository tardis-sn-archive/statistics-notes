The constraints that make it powerful, however, can also hinder practical implementations, particularly those utilizing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. I demonstrate a series of transformations that reshape the canonical Dirichlet distribution into a form much more amenable to MCMC algorithms.},

	abstract = {The statistics of the sum of random weights where the number of weights is Poisson distributed has important applications in nuclear physics, particle physics and astrophysics. Events are frequently weighted according to their acceptance or relevance to a certain type of reaction. The sum is described by the compound Poisson distribution (CPD) which is shortly reviewed. It is shown that the CPD can be approximated by a scaled Poisson distribution (SPD). The SPD is applied to parameter estimation in situations where the data are distorted by resolution effects. It performs considerably better than the normal approximation that is usually used. A special Poisson bootstrap technique is presented which permits to derive confidence limits for observations following the CPD.},

The argument is supported by studying variations on an example by Fisher, and complements Bayes' original argument for a uniform prior predictive distribution for the binomial. The fact that both arguments lead to invariance under transformation is also discussed.},
